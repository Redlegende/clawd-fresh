[0.08s] Claudebot is the most powerful AI tool in the world. The issue is if you use it the wrong way, it could cost you thousands of dollars a month and you wouldn't even know it. In this video, I'll show you how you can run your 24/7 autonomous AI employee for a fraction the cost while still getting the same power out of it. I'll go through every single spending level and show you how to set up Claude to match your exact budget. By the end of this video, if you stick with me to the end, you'll have your Claudebot running even more powerfully for way less money. I'm about to save you tons of cash. Let's get into it.

[36.08s] So, I'm going to go through every single major use case you can do with Claudebot and then go through what is the best model and tool you should be using for each use case and show you the one you should be using if you're trying to save money. Claudebot is amazing because you can plug in a different AI model or tool for every single little thing it does. So, by watching this video, you'll not only know what the best models are, what the cheapest models are, but you also learn about some new use cases I bet you haven't even thought of. So, you're not only going to be using CloudBot better, but you'll be saving tons of money. A double whammy all for the cost of a like down below. So, let's get right into it.

[69.76s] First use case I want to cover with Claudebot is the brain. The way I like to think about Claudebot is the brain is what you communicate with, what you're chatting back and forth with, and then the muscles are every use case the brain calls on. You want to make sure you have the best model for the brain and then the best model for each muscle it calls.

[88.16s] The brain is what you're talking with when you're inside Clawbot. It is very critical when you choose a brain model, you choose one that's not only intelligent, so it knows which muscles to call, but also is warm and personable. When you're talking to your clawbot, you want it to feel human. That's where like half the fun comes from is just feeling like you're talking to a human being.

[106.48s] The best model if money is not a thing in your entire life is Opus 45. It is the most intelligent AI model in the world and is also the most warm and personable model in the world. It is the best to talk to. The issue is that's extremely expensive. So, let's talk about the cheapest one you want to use and that is Kimmy K2.5. This is an extremely cheap model. In fact, they have a bunch of specials at all times. So, you can get like a month basically for free. This is near opus level intelligence and near opus level personality for an absolute fraction of the cost.

[141.12s] If you are concerned about cost savings, this is one of the single biggest levers you can pull to save money. The performance will still be really good from your brain. The personality will still be decently warm. That's probably the biggest weakness of downgrading from Opus is like Opus just feels human being. But you will be spending so much less money from a pure chatbot perspective. You know, just chatting with your Clawbot. If you don't want to spend thousands of dollars a month on Opus, Kimmy K2.5 is the place to go.

[170.72s] Now, here's one that people don't think about that actually Sneaky costs you a ton of money, and that is the heartbeat. For those that don't know, every 10 minutes there is a heartbeat inside your Clawbot. And basically what this heartbeat does is check to see if there's any tasks your Claudebot needs to do. Here's the issue. It by default uses whatever your brain model is. So if you're like most people watching this video and you're using Opus 45 for your brain model, it's calling Opus 45 every 10 minutes to check your heartbeat.

[201.68s] I asked Claudebot how much this heartbeat using Opus is costing me, and it's costing roughly $2 a day. That's $54 a month down the drain off this heartbeat. You do not need to be using Opus for your heartbeat. You should be using Haiku. With Haiku, this will only cost you about 10 cents a day. And on top of that, if you want to save even more money, unless you're doing something where Claudebot is doing different actions every 10 minutes, you don't even need the heartbeat every 10 minutes. I extended mine to every hour. You should be doing the same thing. This will cost you about a penny a day if you do this every hour instead of every 10 minutes.

[238.96s] So, two big changes you want to make immediately. You want to use Haiku. No matter what you're trying to do, whether you want the best or the best cost savings, the heartbeat monitoring is does not need a ton of compute. So, switch to Haiku no matter what. Instantly, you're saving $50 a month. Congratulations.

[253.20s] Next is a big one. If you're anything like me, you have your Clawbot coding every single night while you're sleeping. So, coding is super critical. But which model should you be using for coding? If you do not care about cost, I would highly recommend using Codex GPT 5.2 2 extra high. I found just based on my tests, when your Clawbot is controlling a coding model, it performs best with codecs 5.2 extra high. For those who aren't aware, your Clawbot actually does vibe coding. When it codes, it's not like using claw code or using codecs, your brain is actually calling on the CLI and vibe coding for you.

[293.44s] So, if cost is no issue, I like when it uses codec GPT 5.2 extra high and implement all this. By the way, all you're doing is going to your Claudebot and literally saying, "Please use codeex GBT 5.2 extra high whenever you code. Use the CLI that will have your Claudebot now using these tools for those use cases." So, it is really good when your Opus 45 or Kimmy K 2.5 brain is using the Codeex GPT 5.2 extra high CLI.

[321.52s] If you want to save money for coding, you want to use Miniax 2.1. This is an extremely cheap model. I think they even have a coding specific plan. So, you can spend like a dollar a week on this to get coding done. Is it as good as Codeex? No, not quite as good, but it's still solid. It still gets the job done. This will save you $250 a month off the Codeex Pro plan on Chad GBT. So, if you're looking to save a couple bucks, Miniax 2.1 is the way to go. Still very, very good for a fraction of the cost.

[351.60s] Now there's web search. This is when your Claudebot opens up a browser and starts using the web. The best one here again is going to be Opus 45. Opus45 is spectacular at crawling the web. Again, this is going to cost you a lot of money though. So what happens if you're looking to save some cost? What is a good model for crawling the web? For that, Deepseek V3 is extremely good at web crawling and extracting information from browsers and it is incredibly cheap. If you want to save cost on crawling the web, this is when the browser opens or anything like that. You want to get Deepseek V3 installed. Again, just go to your Claudebot, say, "Hey, I'd like you to use DeepSseek V3 whenever you're controlling the browser. Can we get this set up? It'll ask you for your API key. You put your API key in, it sets it up for you." Boom. You're good to go. You're instantly saving money on web search. This alone will save you hundreds of dollars a month just because it is so expensive to have Opus 45 crawling the web, going on different websites, extracting images, things like that.

[409.12s] So, how about writing content? This is a big use case for a lot of people as well. For me, I have it every night writing me YouTube scripts. Cloudbot's already written me YouTube scripts that have gotten me hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. So, Claudebot is unbelievable at writing content, especially because it talks to you so much. So, it knows your voice. It knows everything you've done. It knows how to write. Writing content is critical. But what is the best model for this?

[431.04s] This probably won't surprise you. But Opus 45 because it has the warmest personality is the best at writing content. It is unbelievable. It feels human. It sounds like me. It is the smartest. Opus 45 dominates. But again, it's very, very expensive. So what happens if you want high quality content for a fraction of the price? In that case, I am going Kimmy K2.5 because in my opinion, out of all the cheaper opensource models, Kimmy K2.5 probably has the best personality of them all. It wouldn't surprise me if Kimmy K2.5 was trained based on Opus. It is so similar in a lot of different ways. So, you're going to get near Opus writing and personality for a fraction of the cost.

[472.88s] By the way, all these models, Kimmy K 2.5, Miniax, DeepSeek, these are local models. So, if you have a powerful enough machine, you'll be able to run these locally completely for free. I actually just bought two Mac Studios so I can run Kimmy K 2.5 locally and get all these tokens for free. I'm going to have way more videos on that. So, if you're interested on running local models so you can get all of this for free, make sure to subscribe and turn on notifications. Super critical. I put out new Claudebot videos every couple days. So, make sure you have notifications on for that. And if you learned anything at all, make sure to leave a like.

[506.40s] I'm curious, by the way, if you're interested in local models, let me know in the chat down below. I don't know how many people really give a crap about local models, so let me know in the replies down below if you want me to make more content on that. But, let's get into voice. I use voice chat a lot. I send voice notes through telegram. Also my Claudebot Henry set up its own phone number for me to call as well. So voice is a big thing for me. So what is the best models for voice here?

[530.88s] For voice I use chat GBT40 real time. It is a very fast powerful voice model. It is really really good. Use their real time API. You'll get very good voice performance for a very good price. Open AAI is pretty reasonable with a lot of their API costs and I'd actually go the same route for cost savings as well. It is a very cost-effective model. You get very good performance. I'm using this both ways.

[557.44s] If you want to set up voice chat for your Cloudbot, which I highly recommend, especially if you're using Telegram, you'll be able to send voice notes and it'll actually send voice notes back to you, which is like the most surreal experience of all time. Ask it to set up this API. It will set it up for you and you'll be able to send messages back and forth. I love this when I'm in my Tesla and it's doing full self-driving. I have my phone on the magnet and I'm able just to send voice notes back and forth while my car is driving for me. That feels like the absolute future. Again, all you need to do is go into here, type in that you want your CloudBot to set up and we'll do all the hard work for you. You just need to get your API key from the OpenAI platform.

[594.00s] And lastly, the last one we're going to do here is image understanding. This is when you have your Claudebot go on the web, check out certain images, looking in your emails, viewing the images in your emails. This is a very important use case. It basically gives your Claudebot eyes for this one, for the best model. This isn't going to surprise you. Opus 45 is the best for image understanding. It I have never had an issue with image understanding for Opus. It is pretty incredible. Again, the issue very expensive.

[620.88s] If you're using Opus 45 for all these, you're probably spending at least $1,000 a month on your API costs. But that brings us to the cost savings. Gemini 2.5 Flash is spectacular image understanding for a fraction of the cost as well. Is it as good as Opus 45? No. But you'll be able to say, "Hey, check out my latest email. What are the images in there? What is sent to me? Check out these tweets. What are the images in these tweets?" Things like that. And you'll still get a very good analysis with Gemini 2.5 Flash.

[650.00s] I'd say the most important ones out of these to set up is you want to make sure you have a good brain. If you're using Opus, this is the biggest cost savings right here. Opus 45 will cost you at least $1,000 a month in API cost if you use Opus. Kimmy K2.5 is massive. A good replacement for a fraction of the cost. Definitely fix the heartbeat immediately to Haiku. You should be changing the heartbeat to check less frequently than every hour. Then you can leave it at whatever time frame you want. But you should definitely be changing it to Haiku for the heartbeat.

[681.12s] And then coding. If you're anything like me, you constantly have your Clawot going out there and coding for you. Make sure you have the right coding model going because coding tasks could take hours on end. And if you're using Opus for coding tasks for hours on end, that's going to cost you a ton. I am all in on Claudebot. I truly believe it is the most powerful awe inspiring technology I've ever used in my life. I have way more content coming. I just spent $20,000 on getting a bunch of Mac Studios so I can absolutely push this technology to the limit. So, make sure you're subscribed. I just ran a full boot camp, by the way, in the Vibe Coding Academy on Cloudbot. It's an hour and a half long. If you want to see that recording, it's available instantly if you join the Vibe Coding Academy. Link down below. I'm doing another boot camp this Friday. So, if you join now, you can also join the boot camp live this Friday. Ask me questions. So much going on in the Vibe Coding Academy. So, check that out as well. I hope this was helpful and I'll see you in the next.
