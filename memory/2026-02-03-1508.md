## Conversation Summary

**Jakob's State:** Stressed about too many priorities, needs to focus on iGMS for accounting/owner statements but feels pulled in many directions (Boligsektor, my capabilities, etc.).

### Key Realization: Browser Autonomy is Critical

Jakob identified that **I cannot autonomously operate browsers** — this is a major blocker for:
- Debugging iGMS OAuth errors
- Accessing logged-in services
- True error diagnosis (I can't see what's actually happening)

### Solution Developed: Hybrid Browser Autonomy

**Two existing tools combined:**
1. **Peekaboo** — macOS UI automation (screenshots, clicks, typing)
2. **Chrome Extension Relay** — Direct DOM access for debugging

**The Hybrid Workflow:**
```
Peekaboo (launch/navigate/click extension) → Browser tool (DOM debugging)
```

**Why this works:**
- Peekaboo handles setup (no permissions needed mid-flow)
- Extension click is automated
- Browser tool provides fast, precise debugging

### Actions Taken

1. ✅ Created `skills/browser-autonomy/` skill with full documentation
2. ✅ Added to **TODO.md** as CRITICAL priority task #1
3. ✅ Added to **PROJECTS.md** as active project
4. ✅ Updated **MEMORY.md** with browser autonomy section
5. ✅ Created test log at `research/igms-oauth-test-log-2026-02-03.md`

### Blockers

**Peekaboo needs permissions:**
- Screen Recording
- Accessibility

These require manual approval in System Settings — cannot be automated.

### Next Steps (From Jakob)

Jakob wants to start a new conversation. The task is now:
- ✅ Documented in all project files
- ✅ Added to Kanban/Observatory task list
- ✅ Skill created and ready

**To proceed:** Grant Peekaboo permissions, then test hybrid workflow on iGMS.

## Key Decisions

1. **Browser autonomy is now TOP PRIORITY** — above Boligsektor work
2. **Hybrid approach chosen** — Peekaboo + Extension (not single-tool)
3. **This unlocks future capabilities** — Once working, I can debug any web app autonomously

## Emotional Context

Jakob is stressed and needs focus. This browser autonomy feature will remove a major friction point (him having to babysit every debug session). It's the right priority.
