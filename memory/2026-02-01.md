# 2026-02-01 — Session Log

## What We Did Today

### 1. Workspace Setup & Migration
- Verified OpenClaw structure against GitHub repo
- Deleted `IDENTITY.md` (not needed, we use SOUL.md)
- Updated `SOUL.md` with Fred's proper identity
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with mandatory session start routine

### 2. Migrated Critical Files from Old Workspace (`clawd/`)
**Projects:**
- `freddy-research-agent/` — Deep research system (Python + Crawl4AI + Moonshot)
- `3dje-boligsektor/` — All project files including PHASE2-APPROACHES.md

**Skills:**
- `auto-updater-1.0.0/` — Daily update checks
- `byterover/` — Knowledge management
- `clawddocs-1.2.2/` — OpenClaw documentation expert

**Systems:**
- `hours/` — Hour tracking with January 2025 data (92.25h | 36,625 kr)
- `research/` — 3dje-boligsektor API research, AI orchestration patterns, etc.

### 3. Updated Core Files
- `MEMORY.md` — Rich context: businesses, integrations, lessons learned
- `PROJECTS.md` — All projects with status and next actions
- `TODO.md` — Active tasks with priorities
- `WORKFLOW.md` — **NEW** — Automatic progress tracking system

### 4. System Design
Created comprehensive workflow document that defines:
- When to update which files (triggers)
- Session-end ritual for tracking progress
- How to determine "what's next"
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Files Changed
- `SOUL.md` — Updated identity
- `AGENTS.md` — Added mandatory reading rules
- `MEMORY.md` — Migrated rich context
- `PROJECTS.md` — Migrated project statuses
- `TODO.md` — Migrated task list
- `WORKFLOW.md` — **Created** — Progress tracking protocol

## Organizational System Established

### Created ORGANIZATION.md
- **Rule:** Project-specific research lives IN the project
- **Rule:** Max 7 projects in /projects/
- **Rule:** YouTube = one main project (no video-sprawl)
- **Hierarchical structure:** Main project → sub-folders → files

### Restructured Files
- `youtube-content/` → `youtube/` (main project)
- Moved `research/3dje-boligsektor/` → `projects/3dje-boligsektor/research/`
- Created `youtube/{video-ideas,scripts,assets,research,notes,analytics}/`

### Health Check System
- Created `scripts/workspace-health-check.sh`
- Daily cron job at 9 AM (Europe/Oslo)
- Checks: project count, empty folders, research orphans

## Current State
- Workspace: ✅ Fully set up with OpenClaw structure
- Migration: ✅ Complete
- Workflow: ✅ Documented
- Organization: ✅ Hierarchical rules established
- Health monitoring: ✅ Cron job active

## What's Next
From TODO.md 🔴 NOW:
1. Connect iGMS OAuth (needs user action)
2. Test iGMS API with real data
3. 3dje Boligsektor Phase 2 planning with Henrik (HIGH PRIORITY)

## Notes
Jakob wants a reliable system where I automatically track progress, update files, and always know what we just did and what's next. Created WORKFLOW.md to codify this.

## 🏗️ Systems Created Today

### 1. Automatic File Update System (WORKFLOW.md)
- Triggers: When I code, complete tasks, learn, plan
- Session-end ritual: Auto-update all status files
- "What's next" detection: Decision tree for next actions

### 2. Hierarchical Project Structure (ORGANIZATION.md)
- Max 7 projects in /projects/
- Research lives IN project folders (not scattered)
- YouTube = main project with sub-folders (video-ideas/, scripts/, research/)
- Deep research → Stored with relevant project for context

### 3. Workspace Health Monitoring
- Script: `scripts/workspace-health-check.sh`
- Cron: Daily 9 AM check
- Checks: Project count, research placement, empty folders, duplicates

### 4. Mandatory Session Protocol (AGENTS.md)
- 7 files to read on EVERY session start
- Includes new ORGANIZATION.md for file placement rules
- No skipping allowed

## 🎯 Key Principles Established

1. **No amnesia:** 7 files read every session automatically
2. **No scatterbrain:** Research lives with projects
3. **No project sprawl:** Max 7 projects, hierarchical structure
4. **Auto-tracking:** I update files without being asked
5. **Health monitoring:** Daily cron checks for organization issues

---

## 🚀 Ready for Next Session

**Next time we talk:**
1. I'll read all 7 core files automatically
2. I'll know exactly where we left off (TODO.md 🔴 NOW)
3. I'll understand the project structure (ORGANIZATION.md)
4. I'll auto-update files as we work (WORKFLOW.md)

**What's next (from TODO.md):**
1. Connect iGMS OAuth (your action needed)
2. 3dje Boligsektor Phase 2 planning with Henrik (HIGH PRIORITY)
