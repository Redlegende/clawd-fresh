## Conversation Summary

assistant: Dashboard is LOADED! Now clicking the extension:
assistant: The extension still isn't attaching. Let me try clicking further right where extension icons are:
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 20:51 GMT+1] Getting started If you see a red ! badge on the extension icon, the relay server is not reachable. Start OpenClaw’s browser relay on this machine (Gateway or node host), then click the toolbar button again. Full guide (install, remote Gateway, security): docs.openclaw.ai/tools/chrome-extension Relay port Port 18792 Save Default: 18792. Extension connects to: http://127.0.0.1:18792/. Only change this if your OpenClaw profile uses a different cdpUrl port. Relay not reachable at http://127.0.0.1:18792/. Start OpenClaw’s browser relay on this machine, then click the toolbar button again. Is the relay port correct?

assistant: The extension is working but can't reach the relay! Let me check the gateway:
assistant: Gateway is running but on port 18790. The extension expects 18792. Let me restart the browser relay:
assistant: Let me click directly on the Chrome toolbar using the correct window:
assistant: Let me try clicking well within Chrome's window bounds:
assistant: Chrome has the extension page open but is behind Firefox! Let me bring it to front:
assistant: I see the extension settings page. Now I need to click the extension icon in Chrome's toolbar to attach THIS tab:
assistant: Let me check the OpenClaw config for the correct relay port:
assistant: The relay is running. I need to go back to the dashboard tab and click the extension THERE:
assistant: Dashboard is loaded! Now clicking the extension icon:
assistant: I see the extension page opened again. Let me go BACK to the dashboard:
assistant: Back at dashboard. Now clicking the extension icon:
assistant: I'm having trouble clicking the exact extension icon. **Can you manually click the OpenClaw extension icon on the Chrome toolbar?** 

Once you click it and the badge shows ON, I'll immediately use the browser tool to:
1. Snapshot the dashboard
2. Find and click "Connect to iGMS"
3. Debug the OAuth flow

Just click the extension and tell me "done" — I'll take it from there!
