## 🌙 Nightly Skill Research Report
**Date:** Monday, February 2, 2026 — 2:00 AM  
**Skills Researched:** 5  
**Source:** clawdhub explore

---

### Summary

| Skill | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **google-calendar** | ✅ INSTALL | Ready for Freddy calendar integration |
| **google-sheet** | ✅ INSTALL | Ready for data export automation |
| **clawmail-skill** | 🤔 MAYBE | Defer — gog covers email needs |
| **docstrange** | 🤔 MAYBE | Keep for complex OCR needs; pdfplumber for hour tracking |
| **agent-builder** | ❌ SKIP | Deleted — template generator, not needed |

---

### ✅ Recommended for Installation

#### 1. google-calendar
**What it does:** Full Google Calendar API wrapper — list, create, update, delete events with OAuth authentication.

**Why install:** Directly aligns with Active Goal #4 (Freddy autonomous calendar management). Clean Python implementation, standard OAuth flow via env vars. Better than gog for dedicated calendar operations.

**Setup needed:**
- Create Google Cloud project + enable Calendar API
- OAuth credentials (Desktop app type)
- Store in secrets: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`

**Location:** `skills/explore/google-calendar/`

---

#### 2. google-sheet
**What it does:** Full Google Sheets management — read, write, append, formatting, column resizing, sheet management via service account.

**Why install:** Perfect for 3dje Boligsektor data exports and hour tracking reporting. Service account auth is automation-friendly (no refresh token hassle). Comprehensive formatting capabilities.

**Setup needed:**
- Google Cloud service account + Sheets API enabled
- Download JSON key, share sheets with service account email
- `npm install` in skill directory

**Location:** `skills/explore/google-sheet/`

---

### 🤔 Deferred (Keep for Future Reference)

#### clawmail-skill
- **Verdict:** Interesting but adds complexity
- **Blocker:** Requires Twitter/X verification for each agent
- **Limit:*…
System: [2026-02-02 04:02:26 GMT+1] Cron: 🔄 **Daily Auto-Update Complete**

**OpenClaw:** ✅ Already up to date (v2026.1.30 — latest from npm registry)

**Skills:** ✅ All local skills — no registry updates available

| Skill | Version | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| auto-updater | 1.0.0 | Local/custom |
| byterover | — | Local/custom |
| clawddocs | 1.2.2 | Local/custom |
| project-automation | — | Local/custom |

**Note:** Your skills are all custom/local workspace skills. They don't update via the registry. If you want to update them, pull latest from their respective sources manually.

### 🔴 Active Tasks That Need Action Today

| Task | Action Needed | Est. Time |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **🎯 3dje Boligsektor — Apply for Kartverket Matrikkel agreement** | This is the **blocker** for automatic owner lookup. Start application at geonorge.no. | 30 min |
| **🔗 Connect iGMS OAuth** | Go to https://app-pink-eight-65.vercel.app → click "Connect iGMS" → authorize. Code is ready, just needs your click. | 5 min |
| **📁 Read `MVP-SCOPE-AND-PLAN.md`** | Start of Day 1 for Boligsektor Phase 2. Located in `projects/3dje-boligsektor/`. | 15 min |
| **🛰️ The Observatory — Provide credentials** | Garmin connect credentials + Supabase project details needed to complete last night's autonomous build. Check Telegram report from yesterday. | 10 min |

---

### 📊 Project Status Overview

| Project | Status | Blocker |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **3dje Boligsektor** | 🔴 **Week 1 of 5-day MVP build** — Demo + presentation for apartment developers by Friday | Kartverket Matrikkel agreement (owner lookup) |
| **Kvitfjellhytter** | ✅ Deployed → Needs connection test | Your OAuth authorization |
| **The Observatory** | 🏗️ Built overnight → Needs credentials | Garmin login + Supabase details |
| **Hour Tracking** | ✅ Phase 1A working | None (Phase 1B = install poppler when ready) |

---

### 🎯 Top Priority for the Day

**#1: Apply for Kartverket Matrikkel agreement** — Without this, you can't do automatic property owner lookups for the Boligsektor tomte-sourcing system. Manual verification is the fallback, but the agreement unlocks the scalable path.

**#2: Connect iGMS OAuth** — Takes 30 seconds, unblocks testing the full booking sync.

**#3: Read the MVP plan** — Sets up your Day 1 work (pilot municipality selection + Python environment setup).

---

*Phase 2 research is complete. Build documents are ready. This week is about execution.*

[Telegram Jakob Bakken (@jakbakbus) id:6946509790 +32s 2026-02-02 08:37 GMT+1] What do you need for the Garmin connect? Can you find a link or do you just need the login details? Also, what do you need for supabase ? Can you give me a link and I’ll give it to you.
[message_id: 682]
assistant: **Observatory is LIVE!** 🎉  
**URL:** https://observatory-dashboard-two.vercel.app

I can see it deployed successfully overnight. Now for your questions:

## 1. Garmin Connect

I need your **login credentials** (email + password) to connect to your Garmin account. The Fitness Lab module needs this to sync your:
- Body Battery data
- VO2 Max trends  
- Workout history
- Sleep scores

**Security note:** I'd store these locally only, not in the code. The connection uses Garmin's official API wrapper.

## 2. Supabase - Already Done!

✅ **Supabase project created:** `observatory-dashboard`  
✅ **Connected to the app** - it's already working!

You can view your database here:  
**https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vhrmxtolrrcrhrxljemp**

I need to create the database tables for:
- Tasks (for Kanban)
- Research notes  
- Projects
- Future: Fitness metrics, Finance entries

Want me to set up the tables now? I can create the schema and you'll be able to start using Mission Control + Kanban + Research Reader immediately.

Also - **check out the Observatory!** Open https://observatory-dashboard-two.vercel.app and tell me what you think. Dark mode, left nav, all three MVP modules ready. The "Coming Soon" pages are placeholders for Fitness, Finance, Calendar, and Projects (as planned).

assistant: Let me try with a lighter model:
assistant: I had trouble transcribing the audio clearly (Whisper only detected "💦" - possibly a very short clip). Could you type out what you said? 

Based on your text follow-up, it sounded like you were asking:
1. **Garmin Connect** - You asked if I need a link or login details → **I need login details** (email + password). No link needed, I'll connect via the API.

2. **Supabase** - You asked if I need a link → **Already done!** Supabase is set up and connected. You can view it at: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vhrmxtolrrcrhrxljemp

**Current status:**
- ✅ Observatory deployed: https://observatory-dashboard-two.vercel.app
- ✅ Supabase connected
- ⏳ Waiting on: Garmin credentials (for Fitness Lab)

Want me to create the database tables now so Mission Control + Kanban + Research Reader are fully functional?
user: [Telegram Jakob Bakken (@jakbakbus) id:6946509790 +1m 2026-02-02 08:44 GMT+1] Kontakt@kvitfjellhytter.no gladiator12! Yes please make all the tables and fill them with the right info, also maken sure it will stay up to date.
[message_id: 686]
assistant: Got it! Setting up the database tables now and securing your Garmin credentials locally.
assistant: Let me create a setup script using the Supabase client:
