## Conversation Summary

assistant: Now let me restart the gateway to apply the new heartbeat configuration:
user: how are we doing
[message_id: 54b1a3e9-f14c-41a6-bcf8-127c3108f395]
assistant: Good! Here's the status:

## ✅ Heartbeat Fix Applied
- **Problem:** Multiple heartbeat polls were firing at the same time (seen on Feb 1st at 09:00)
- **Solution:** Added explicit heartbeat config to `clawdbot.json`:
  - Interval: **4 hours** (as documented in HEARTBEAT.md)
  - Active hours: **08:00–23:00** (Europe/Oslo)
  - Max alert length: 100 chars (prevents spam)
- Gateway restarted, new config is live

## 🟡 NEXT — Backlog (Top 3)

**High Priority:**
1. **Fix Supabase RLS policy recursion** — bookings query failing
2. **3dje Boligsektor Phase 2** — Need to schedule with Henrik
3. **Hour Tracking Phase 1B** — Install PDF tools (`poppler`)

**Medium:**
- Add property images to dashboard
- Booking calendar view
- Morning Brief System (daily 8 AM automation)

---

## 💡 Bottom Line
You've got **one blocking task**: connecting iGMS OAuth. Everything else in Kvitfjellhytter is waiting for that. 

Want me to:
- Help troubleshoot the iGMS OAuth flow?
- Tackle the Supabase RLS recursion error?
- Schedule something with Henrik for 3dje Boligsektor?
user: How do i set up a fresh version of moltbot, with a ned file system etc
[message_id: 1911c49b-220e-46f2-9b32-a4edf7738061]
assistant: You probably mean **Clawdbot** (the system we're using now). Here's how to set up a fresh instance with a clean workspace:

## 🏗️ Fresh Clawdbot Setup

### Option 1: New Workspace Directory (Recommended)
```bash
# Create new workspace
mkdir -p ~/new-clawd-project
cd ~/new-clawd-project

# Create core structure
mkdir -p memory projects skills

# Essential files to create
touch AGENTS.md
touch TODO.md  
touch PROJECTS.md
touch USER.md
touch SOUL.md
touch TOOLS.md
```

### Option 2: Use Clawdbot CLI
```bash
# Check if init command exists
clawdbot init --help

# Or let the wizard set it up
clawdbot doctor
```

## 📁 Minimal Fresh Structure

```
~/your-new-project/
├── AGENTS.md          # Your workspace rules (like the Territory Map)
├── TODO.md            # Single source of truth for tasks
├── PROJECTS.md        # Active projects list
├── USER.md            # Who you're helping (preferences, context)
├── SOUL.md            # Who you are (personality, boundaries)
├── TOOLS.md           # Environment-specific notes (cameras, SSH, etc.)
├── MEMORY.md          # Long-term curated memory
├── HEARTBEAT.md       # Periodic task checks (optional)
├── memory/            # Daily notes (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
├── projects/          # Project folders
└── skills/            # Custom skills
```

## 🔧 Then Configure Gateway

Point the new workspace in your config:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "workspace": "/Users/jakobbakken/your-new-project"
    }
  }
}
```

**Want me to:**
1. Generate a fresh starter pack with templates?
2. Show you how to migrate specific data from your current setup?
3. Set up a parallel instance alongside your current one?

What are you building that needs the clean slate?
user: i need to set up a clean slate alongside you, that starts from frsh, so that i can see that it is working correctly
[message_id: 326506b1-3b33-49f4-830a-f664f7642392]
assistant: Got it. Let me set up a completely fresh Clawdbot instance alongside the current one. I'll create a clean workspace and show you how to run it independently.
assistant: Now let me create a minimal config for the fresh instance:
assistant: Perfect! Here's your fresh setup:

## ✅ Fresh Instance Created

**Location:** `~/clawd-fresh/`

```
clawd-fresh/
├── AGENTS.md          ← Workspace rules & Territory Map
├── TODO.md            ← Your clean task list
├── USER.md            ← User profile (empty, fill it in)
├── SOUL.md            ← Assistant personality
├── PROJECTS.md        ← Project tracker
├── TOOLS.md           ← Environment notes
├── clawdbot.json      ← Config (port 18790)
├── memory/
│   └── 2026-02-01.md  ← First daily note
├── projects/          ← Empty project folder
└── skills/            ← Empty skills folder
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

### Option 1: Terminal with custom config
```bash
# Start fresh gateway on port 18790
export CLAWDBOT_CONFIG=/Users/jakobbakken/clawd-fresh/clawdbot.json
clawdbot gateway start
```

### Option 2: Run alongside current instance
```bash
# Terminal 1: Your current instance (already running on 18789)
# Terminal 2: Fresh instance
clawdbot gateway start --config ~/clawd-fresh/clawdbot.json --port 18790
```

### Option 3: Quick test (one-off)
```bash
# Run a single command in fresh workspace
clawdbot --workspace ~/clawd-fresh --config ~/clawd-fresh/clawdbot.json "Read TODO.md"
```

---

## 🔗 Connect to Fresh Instance

**Web UI:** `http://localhost:18790`

Or open a new terminal and:
```bash
export CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:18790
export CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN=fresh-instance-token-change-me
clawdbot chat
```

---

## 🧪 Test It's Working

1. Open web UI at `http://localhost:18790`
2. Send: "Read AGENTS.md and tell me what my workspace structure is"
3. Should respond with the Territory Map from the fresh files

---

**Both instances can run simultaneously:**
- **Original:** Port 18789 (your main workspace)
- **Fresh:** Port 18790 (clean slate)

Want me to start the fresh gateway for you, or do you want to test it yourself?
user: you there
[message_id: 2e481ec5-2fc5-4310-9404-8c795f64396d]
assistant: Yes, I'm here. 

The fresh Clawdbot instance is ready at `~/clawd-fresh/`. 

Want me to start it up so you can test it?
user: yes
