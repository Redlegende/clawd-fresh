## Health & Lifestyle

- L. reuteri yogurt (SIBO protocol from Dr. Davis's "Supergut" book)
- Managing/curing SIBO
- Optimized sleep and nutrition
- Recovery under 24 hours from workouts

**Diet rules:**
- No glyphosate or gut-harming pesticides
- No antibiotic-like agricultural chemicals
- Almost everything cooked from scratch
- Eating out = cheat meal

**Likes:** Eggs, ground beef, chicken, salmon, tuna, lentils, beans, hummus, avocado, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, kesam, spinach, tomatoes, potatoes, sweet potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, pasta, rice, cheese, ham, turkey cold cuts, mayo

**Avoids:** Overnight oats, oats (unless verified glyphosate-free)

## Notes

**Mental health journey:**
- Suffered depression for years prior to December 2025
- Lowest point: drinking heavily, living with friend, eating junk, feeling like complete failure
- Couldn't relax — always felt like there was something else to do
- Procrastination loop driven by dopamine dysregulation
- **Cured depression in days** by changing diet (specifically gut-friendly bread)
- Went from super low energy to "so so happy every day"
- Now can actually relax and enjoy activities

**Past struggles:**
- Tried 100+ diets (low-carb, keto, calorie restriction)
- Bodybuilding phase: looked good but was "very very sick"
- Followed fitness gurus, ate protein bars/sugar-free drinks, avoided carbs AND fat
- Required extreme discipline 24/7 — unsustainable
- Quit sugar once (hardest thing he's done)

**Current state:**
- Never been stronger or happier
- Building muscle faster than "humanly possible"
- No discipline required — natural satiety and satisfaction
- "Anabolic gains super quickly" with optimized sleep + nutrition

**Preferences:**
- Wants to document everything (progress videos, holistic documentary)
- Loves speaking in long rants — will send transcripts
- Values scientific backing but trusts personal experience
- Interested in Dr. Davis protocols, fermentation, gut health research
